###Content Types###
As mentioned earlier, a content type serves as a "blueprint" of content items in the system. For example, take the *Page* content type. The Page content type consists of the following content parts:

- Content Type
	- Name ("Page")
	- Parts
		- TitlePart
		- AutoroutePart
		- BodyPart
		- CommonPart

Whenever you create a new content item of the **Page** content type, that content item will have the exact same copy of content parts. The actual values of each part will be stored in the content item's parts themselves.
