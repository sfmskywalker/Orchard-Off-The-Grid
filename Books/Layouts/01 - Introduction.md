## Introduction ##

This book is the first book of the "Orchard - Off The Grid" series which will take the reader on a journey through the wonderful and exciting world of *Orchard Layouts*. The Layouts module was released with Orchard 1.9, setting a new milestone in Orchard's history that started all the way back in 2009. 

The primary purpose of the Layouts module is to enable users to visually layout various types of elements onto a canvas. These elements can be laid out in grids, similar to the way grids work in frameworks such as [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), providing a whole new way for content editors to create and layout content straight from the editor.

This book is divided in three parts.

**Part 1** is all about introducing the Layouts module and getting a better understanding of how to use this shiny new feature.

**Part 2** takes us a step further by looking at the various shapes and templates available to us when working with custom themes. In this part, we will see how to customize various element shapes as well as which shapes to override in what way in order to take advantage of rid frameworks such as Bootstrap.

**Part 3** is specifically written for the Orchard module developer out there who is looking for a better understanding of how the module works on a technical level and learn about its extensibility in order to create custom elements and element harvesters.
