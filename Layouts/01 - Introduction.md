## Introduction ##

This book is part of the "Orchard Off The Grid" series which takes the reader on a journey through the wonderful and exciting world of the **Orchard Project**, which saw the light of day all the way back in 2009.

The **Layouts** module was released as part of Orchard 1.9, setting a new milestone in Orchard's history, enabling users to visually layout all **elements** on a canvas. 

The book is divided in four parts.

**Part 1** introduces the Layouts module and looks at it from a user's perspective.

**Part 2** goes a step further and looks at the various shapes and templates from a theme developer's perspective.

**Part 3** takes a deep dive and looks at the module from a developer's point of view. Here we'll learn about extensibility and APIs and how to create custom elements and element harvesters.

**Part 4** takes everything we learned in the first three parts by writing a real-world theme in combination with layouts and custom elements. We'll also build a slide shows module that reuses the various Layouts APIs.
