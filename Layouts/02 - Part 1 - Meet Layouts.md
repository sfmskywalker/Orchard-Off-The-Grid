## Part 1 - Meet Layouts ##
Welcome to Part 1. In this part, we'll get to see what the Layouts module entails from a user's perspective. This will help to find your way around the UI as well as getting familiar with concepts such as Layouts and Elements within the context the **Orchard.Layouts** module.

I divided this part in 8 chapters:

**Chapter 1 - Introduction to Layouts**

Here we'll talk a little about what layouts are and why we need them in Orchard.

**Chapter 2 - First Look**

This chapter provides an introductory tour around the various aspects of the Layouts feature.

**Chapter 3 - Meet the Elements**

The third chapter documents all of the available elements provided out of the box in Orchard 1.10.

**Chapter 4 - Layout Templates**

Here we'll learn what layout templates are and how and when to use them.

**Chapter 5 - Element Blueprints**

This chapter explains what Element Blueprints are, how to use them and when.

**Chapter 6 - Elements as Widgets**

In this chapter, we will see how we can reuse elements as actual widgets. This is useful for developers that would normally write new functionality as widgets, but who are considering implementing that same functionality as elements as well. Since implementing a custom element is quite similar to writing a custom content part, developers should consider writing just the element implementation and then turning that into a widget.

**Chapter 7 - Element Tokens**

Elements are not just there for being placed on a canvas. They can also be rendered standalone, as this chapter on Element tokens will show.

**Chapter 8 - Element Rules**

Similar to Widget Layer Rules, Element Rules enable us to write a visibility rule on a per-element level. In this chapter, we'll see a demonstration of how that works.
