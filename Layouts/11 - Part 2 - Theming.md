## Part 2 - Theming ##

Welcome to part 2 of this book on Layouts. In the first part, we learned about Layouts and Elements, and how to use them. In this second part, we'll learn how to work with layouts, elements and themes from a theme developer's perspective. More specifically, we'll see what shape templates to override and how to write custom alternates for your ultimate theming pleasures.

Part 2 is divided in the following 3 chapters:

**Chapter 9 - Theming**

This chapter provides a primer on Shapes, which is at the heart of Orchard's rendering system. It also explains how elements relate to shapes, and what shape templates and alternates are available.

**Chapter 10 - Bootstrap**

Since many themes these days are implemented with grid CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, I figured it wold be useful to demonstrate how to deal with layouts, elements and Bootstrap. If you are a theme developer that works with such frameworks, this chapter is for you.

**Chapter 11 - Snippets**

This chapter goes into more detail of Snippet elements and demonstrates how to provide them from your theme. More excitingly, it shows you how to create custom elements as Snippets that can be configured by the user. No modules necessary, just a Razor view is all it takes.
