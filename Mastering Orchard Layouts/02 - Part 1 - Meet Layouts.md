## Part 1 - Meet Layouts ##
In part 1, we'll get to see what the Layouts module is all about from a user's perspective. This will help to find your way around the various UI parts provided by the module and to get familiar with the some of the new concepts.

This part is divided in 8 chapters:

**Chapter 1 - Introduction to Layouts**

In chapter 1, we'll talk a little about what layouts are and why we need them in Orchard.

**Chapter 2 - First Look**

This chapter takes the reader on a tour around the various aspects of the Layouts feature.

**Chapter 3 - Meet the Elements**

The third chapter documents all of the available elements provided out of the box in Orchard 1.10. Elements are what make the Layouts module 'tick'.

**Chapter 4 - Layout Templates**

In chapter 4 we'll learn what layout templates are and how and when to use them.

**Chapter 5 - Element Blueprints**

This chapter explains what Element Blueprints are, how to use them and when.

**Chapter 6 - Elements as Widgets**

In this chapter, we will see how we can reuse elements as actual widgets.

**Chapter 7 - Element Tokens**

Elements are not just there for being placed on a canvas. They can also be rendered standalone, as this chapter on Element tokens will demonstrate.

**Chapter 8 - Element Rules**

Similar to Widget Layer Rules, Element Rules enable us to write a visibility rule on a per-element level. In this chapter, we'll see a demonstration of how that works.
