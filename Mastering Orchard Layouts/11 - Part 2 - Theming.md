## Part 2 - Theming

Welcome to part 2! In the first part, we learned about Layouts and Elements, and how to use them. In this second part, we'll learn how to work with layouts, elements and themes from a theme developer's perspective. More specifically, we'll see what shape templates to override and how to write custom alternates for your ultimate theming pleasures.

Part 2 is divided into the following 3 chapters:

**Chapter 9 - Theming**

This chapter provides a primer on Shapes, which is at the heart of Orchard's rendering system. It also explains how elements relate to shapes, and what shape templates and alternates are available.

**Chapter 10 - Bootstrap**

Many themes these days are implemented with grid CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap, and this chapter shows how to deal with layouts, elements and Bootstrap combined. If you are a theme developer that works with CSS grid frameworks, this chapter is for you.

**Chapter 11 - Snippets**

This chapter goes into more detail of **configurable Snippets** without the need for a custom module. Just a Razor view is all it takes.
